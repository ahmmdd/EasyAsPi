            When you count pie from 0 to 10, 0 is smallest and 10 is biggest.  Therefore, 0 pie will
            be less than 1 pie, and 2 pies will be more than 1 pie.  So... 2 pies are more than 0 pie!

            <instruction>Addition is easy! You have 1 pie. If you get 1 more pie from your friend, you will have 2 pies! 1 plus 1 is 2!
            When you got home with your 2 pies, mommy made 2 more pies for you.  You now have 4 pies, since 2 plus 2 is 4.
            Substraction is easy as addition too!
            You are hungry, so you ate 1 pie, therefore, you only have 3 pies! 4 minus 1 is 3.
            So how many pies are there left for you to eat?</instruction>
